**Postdoctoral Scholar — Quantum Benchmarking & Simulation (AQT/NERSC) - 105230**

Division: **AM-Applied Mathematics and Computational Research**

Lawrence Berkeley National Lab’s (Berkeley Lab) Applied Math and Computational Research Division (AMCR) has an opening in the QuIST (Quantum Information Science and Technology) Group for a Post-doctoral Scholar to advance the validation of quantum computers operating in the classical-hardness regime. You will design and execute state-of-the-art experiments on superconducting quantum processors, lead large-scale benchmarking across the full stack, and develop scalable classical simulations (e.g., tensor networks)—including performance bounds beyond brute-force classical simulability. This role is deeply collaborative with the Advanced Quantum Testbed (AQT) and the NERSC Advanced Technologies Group, offering access to world-class experimental facilities and supercomputing resources.

What You Will Do:

Lead large-scale benchmarking of full-stack quantum processing units (QPUs).
Develop and validate performance bounds for QPUs beyond brute-force classical simulability.
Design and conduct experiments on contemporary quantum hardware platforms (e.g., superconducting quantum processors).
Validate, analyze, and interpret experimental data and results.
Simulate the performance of quantum circuits on classical supercomputers.
Design and optimize classical simulation algorithms for quantum circuits.
Explore approximate classical simulation algorithms (e.g., tensor networks, circuit cutting) to improve scalability.
Publish scientific papers and present results to diverse audiences.
What is Required:

Ph.D. in Physics, Applied Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field.

Demonstrated experience independently planning and completing projects.
Hands-on experience with state-of-the-art experiments on contemporary quantum hardware platforms.
Experience with numerical algorithms (e.g., tensor networks) for simulating quantum computer performance.
Relevant publication record and clear, effective written/oral communication of scientific results.
Knowledge of quantum information science relevant to the responsibilities above.
Proven ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams (engineers, scientific staff, technicians, students).
Ability to prepare periodic written and oral updates for internal/external reviews or reports.
Proficiency with Python-based scientific programming tools.
Desired Qualifications:

Knowledge of superconducting qubits and device physics.
Experience with gate calibration on superconducting QPUs.
Knowledge of noise and error sources in superconducting systems.
Familiarity with benchmarking and characterization methods for quantum computers.
Experience with tensor network methods and other scalable approximations.
Experience running large-scale computations on supercomputers (e.g., SLURM job scripts, GPU acceleration, MPI communication).
Notes:

This is a full-time, 2 year, postdoctoral appointment with the possibility of renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds and ongoing operational needs. You must have less than 3 years of paid postdoctoral experience. Salary for Postdoctoral positions depends on years of experience post-degree.
This position is represented by a union for collective bargaining purposes.
The monthly salary range for this position is $6,924 - $8,026 and is expected to start at $6924 or above. Postdoctoral positions are paid on a step schedule per union contract and salaries will be predetermined based on postdoctoral step rates. Each step represents one full year of completed post-Ph.D. postdoctoral experience.
This position is subject to a background check. Any convictions will be evaluated to determine if they directly relate to the responsibilities and requirements of the position. Having a conviction history will not automatically disqualify an applicant from being considered for employment.
Work will be primarily performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA. A REAL ID or other acceptable form of identification is required to access Berkeley Lab sites.
