# Welcome to My Website!

This is where I share my projects and ideas.

## Projects:

- [x] Quantum optimization problems;
      
- [x] Quantum key distribution with quantum computing;
      Here, I entend to simulating entanglement based quantum key distribution (the E91 protocol) in quantum computers. I demonstrate that the secure
      key rate depends on the selected quantum hardware qubit-pair on which the experiment is executed, in the sense that the pair of qubit with lower two-
      qubit error provide lower quantum bit error rate and higher key length, independent of eavesdroper's interference. You can find full detailled algorithm on [my github page](https://github.com/AGT2025-Quantum-computing-communication/Efficient-algorithm-for-variational-quantum-linear-solver)
- [x]  Quantum Circuit Visualizer;
      
- [x] Android  Applications.

This group is dedicated to the research in the field of quantum information and optics. We are part of the School of Chemistry and Physics at the  **[University of KwaZulu-Natal](https://ukzn.ac.za)**.
<p>
Our research areas include the theory of quantum communication and quantum teleportation with spatial light modes. In this context, we search for convenient ways within quantum optics to combine the descriptions of the spatial degrees of freedom of light and the number of photons. We also study the possibilities to use Optics in Quantum Information Processing. For example, classical light can be used to detect atmospheric disturbance when communicating with single photons and correct resulting errors.
