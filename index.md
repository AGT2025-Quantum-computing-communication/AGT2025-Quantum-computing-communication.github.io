    This is where I share my projects and ideas.

## Projects:

- [x] **Quantum optimization problems;**<br>
      In this project my aims is to provide efficient algorithms for solving optimization problems in current noisy-intermediate scale quantum computers on
      one hand and a variational quantum linear solver algorithms for high dimensional systems, with application to Poisson equation on the other hand.
      Starting from the latest algorithm, it consists of employing the parallelism advantage that offers quantum computers to speedup the convergence to
      the target state(solution), within a reasonable time limit. You can find a fully detailed efficient algorithm for VQLS  on [my github page.](https://github.com/AGT2025-Quantum-computing-communication/Efficient-algorithm-for-variational-quantum-linear-solver)
      
- [x] **Quantum key distribution with quantum computing;**<br>
      Here, I intend to simulating entanglement based quantum key distribution (the E91 protocol) in quantum computers. I demonstrate that the secure
      key rate depends on the selected quantum hardware qubit-pair on which the experiment is executed, in the sense that the pair of qubit with lower two-
      qubit error provide lower quantum bit error rate and higher key length, independent of eavesdropper’s interference. You can find a fully detailed
      algorithm on [my github page.](https://github.com/AGT2025-Quantum-computing-communication/Efficient-algorithm-for-variational-quantum-linear-solver)

- [x] **Android  Applications.**

This group is dedicated to the research in the field of quantum information and optics. We are part of the School of Chemistry and Physics at the  **[University of KwaZulu-Natal](https://ukzn.ac.za)**.
<p>
Our research areas include the theory of quantum communication and quantum teleportation with spatial light modes. In this context, we search for convenient ways within quantum optics to combine the descriptions of the spatial degrees of freedom of light and the number of photons. We also study the possibilities to use Optics in Quantum Information Processing. For example, classical light can be used to detect atmospheric disturbance when communicating with single photons and correct resulting errors.
